A journal web application built on the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React and Node.js). The app features a calm, focus-centric UI and the options to add, edit, and delete journal entries, as well as an archive page to view past entries. It also integrates a microservice that fetches real-time data to display the current location and weather conditions.
